Overview

This project applies K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify different species of Iris flowers based on sepal and petal measurements. The model is trained on labeled data and optimized by testing different k values for the best classification accuracy.

Features

âœ… Feature Selection â€“ Uses petal and sepal length/width for classification.

âœ… KNN Model Optimization â€“ Evaluates multiple k values to find the best accuracy.

âœ… Train-Test Split â€“ Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.

âœ… Accuracy Analysis â€“ Visualizes accuracy scores for different k values.

âœ… Predictive Model â€“ Can classify new flower samples based on input measurements.

Tech Stack
